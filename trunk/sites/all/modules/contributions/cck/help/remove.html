<p>When you remove a field from a content type, the data it holds are
<strong>permanently</strong> erased. You will be asked to confirm this action</p>

<p>>You will have to manually update your Views, pathauto settings, etc... if
needed.</p>

<p>Note : if the field is shared across several content types, removing it from
one content type does <strong>not</strong> affect the data for the other content
types.</p>
