                        LOG OF CHANGES

Most recent changes are at the top of the list.

2009-01-20	Syscrusher

	New feature: Administrative option allows rel="nofollow"
	attribute on external links, per issue #144620.

	New feature: Administrative option allows direct links
	(skipping redirect page, at the cost of no click
	counting). Separately controllable for internal and
	external links.

	New feature: Optional logging of all external redirects,
	primarily for diagnostic purposes but also useful if the
	site owner wants really detailed click tracking.

	Added #maxlength attribute for URL textfields to allow
	longer values, per issue #232575.

2009-01-15	Syscrusher

	Oops. Should NOT have used db_next_id() in Drupal 6.
	Corrected this to use drupal_write_record(). I will
	be looking at a more comprehensive update to the
	links_put_links() function but for now just wanted
	to get this critical bug fixed. This fixes issue #359071.

2009-01-12	Syscrusher

	Removed obsolete call to _system_update_utf8() in
	links.install to fix issue #356994.

	Changed incorrect db_last_insert_id() call to instead
	use db_next_id().

	Applied patch from issue #357437 to fix failure of
	outbound link.

	Applied patch to fix filter tips bug reported in #357335.

2009-01-01	Syscrusher

	Omit links to edit node references in cases where there
	are no such references for a particular node.

	Delete operation for an individual link-node reference
	was too broad; narrowed scope.

2008-12-31	Syscrusher

	TRANSLATORS: Updated template to unify in po/links.pot.

	Fixed issue #341487 in links_weblink.

	Fixed issue #132209 in links_weblink, although the patch
	attached to that issue was not actually the fix for the
	problem in the D6 version of the module.

	Fixed issue #147226 (translation of "Visit") in links.inc.

	Implemented the direct-weblink feature requested in #147893.

	Fixed missing links tab in links_related.

2008-12-30	Syscrusher

	Removed an extraneous diagnostic stub from links_admin.

2008-12-29	Syscrusher

	links_admin.module is now fully functional and ready
	for a beta release.

	Added feature to allow deleting node references from
	a given link on the sub-screen.

	Added filter capabilities to the main links management
	screen.

	Added links_admin.css stylesheet to format the filter
	criteria form.

	General cleanup of code and moving functions into more
	appropriate locations within the file.

2008-12-27	Syscrusher

	Fully functional links_admin.module. Some new
	APIs in links.inc. Removed an extraneous diagnostic
	message from links_weblink.module.

	This is the initial beta release of links_admin.

2008-12-25	Syscrusher

	Further development work on the links_admin
	module, with some enhancements to the links API
	itself. The API changes are backward-compatible,
	as the newly-added parameters are optional.

2008-12-22	Syscrusher

	Another interim commit. Much of links_admin is
	now functional. The sub-page to list referring
	nodes is not done yet.

	Added documentation for the new hooks in API.html.
	Developers, pay heed!

	Updated links_related and links_weblink to
	implement the new hooks as appropriate.

2008-12-21	Syscrusher

	Early version of links_admin.module with some
	functionality. Forms display but do NOT actually
	update anything yet. PRE-ALPHA code!

2008-12-11	Syscrusher

	Added a new feature whereby the administrator can cause
	the related links fieldset to always be expanded, even
	if there are currently no links. The default behavior
	remains unchanged; this is a new option.

2008-11-12	Syscrusher

	links_weblink is now fully functional and ready for
	beta testing. Note the addition of a stylesheet to
	the repository for this release.

2008-10-31	Syscrusher

	Another interim commit. The form is now invoking the
	various themes, but not everything is working right yet.
	Still a development release.

2008-10-31	Syscrusher

	Interim commit. links_weblink is now functional, although
	a long way from cosmetically correct. On the plus side,
	error handling for missing vocabulary and/or categories
	for the weblinks is much more graceful than in previous
	versions.

2008-07-16	Syscrusher

	Fixed bugs in links.inc that were preventing links from
	saving. There were no API changes in this update, just
	bug fixes, and these were D6-specific and do not need to
	be back-ported.

	Minor updates to links_related.module to fix some small
	bugs with the node edit form.

	Initial commit of links_weblink.module. This is an "alpha"
	commit, not fully functional yet. At this time, weblink
	nodes can be created and edited, and the admin page works,
	but the weblinks directory does not yet display.

2008-07-14	Syscrusher

	Fixed the cosmetic problem in the related links edit form.

2008-07-06	Syscrusher

	Further progress on the Drupal 6 port. Still ALPHA level
	code, not for production use, but we are a lot closer.
	links.module and links_related.module are mostly functional
	except for a cosmetic problem with the related links editing
	form in nodes.

2007-12-31	Syscrusher

	Initial port of links.inc and links.module to Drupal 6.
	WARNING: Alpha-level code -- not for production!
	The links_related and links_weblink modules are not ported yet.

2007-12-11	Syscrusher	Version 5--1-8

	A host of minor bug fixes and small features. Life is finally
	starting to settle down after an extremely busy few months, and
	I hope to get more improvements out in the next several weeks.

	Today's patches include:

	Accepted patch from #114151, from jvandervort, to fix the order
	of categories in links_weblink. Also took his suggestion for a
	parallel change to fix the order of the child catefories. Thanks.

	Accepted patch from #150970 to fix HTML visible in some of the
	admin pages, and to update links that have changed in recent
	Drupal core revisions. Many thanks to lyricnz for this patch.
	This should also fix #150906.

	Added bracketing of links_lid string in links.inc to fix #188655,
	where link ID sequence did not respect table prefix. Thanks to
	jonathan_hunt for finding the bug and suggesting the fix.

	Fixed #147226, lack of t() call for "Visit" in links.inc, as
	reported by jvlagsma.

	Fixed deprecated PHP syntax in links_related, per #195430. Thanks
	to vacilando for reporting the problem.

	Made body field optional, per #131637, as suggested by teleted,
	elondaits, and dman.

2007-05-03	Syscrusher	Version 5--1-7

	Added "edit own weblinks" permission per issue #76527. Thanks to
	yched for contributing the patch.

2007-04-27	Syscrusher

	Added translation templates ("po" directory) and the Spanish
	translation contributed by elondaits, per issue #133306.

	API CHANGE: The function links_get_links() will now return NULL if no
	links are found, rather than returning an array with two elements
	that are themselves empty. This simplifies testing for values on
	return, but may cause errors for code that relied upon the function
	always returning an array before. This change is pursuant to #139067.

	API CHANGE: The function links_get_list() now accepts an additional
	parameter $statistics, which defaults to FALSE. This parameter
	determines whether the click count is returned as part of the
	link title, if other conditions (such as user permissions) would
	permit it so. Existing code that wants the click count enabled
	will need to add this parameter as TRUE.

	Fixed incorrect use of #value (should be #default_value) for
	URL form declaration in links_weblink.module, per issue #128620.

2007-04-26	Syscrusher	Version 5--1-6

	Fixed critical error #139529 in links.inc.

2007-04-25	Syscrusher	Version 5--1-5

	Applied patch to resolve #117108, an empty "target" attribute
	on links_weblink link tags, if the target is not specified.
	Thanks to RayZ for the patch.

	Applied patch to resolve #130890, an SQL error with MySQL 5.x
	at installation time. Thanks to Denny for the patch.

	Added package and dependencies information to .info files.

	Committed partial fix for #132209, based on a patch from
	douggreen but with some additional bug fixes. This resolves
	the issue for the Related Links listing, but not yet for
	the Links from Article Text listing. That fix is on hold
	until after another patch is applied, because fixing that
	now would break the next patch.

	Committed large patch for #139130, by dman. This patch
	fixes many problems with Blocks, improves form handling,
	adds the 'edit related links' page, and iproves rendering
	of the related links table.

	The #139130 patch also adds three functions to the 'edit
	links' page under the 'links' tab of nodes:
	* Create a links_weblink node page for the related link
	  (this will make a new node in addition to the one being
	  edited).
	* Attach the embedded link to the current node as a related
	  link.
	* If links_admin is enabled, go to the editing page for
	  the embedded link or add it to the links catalog.

	Note that the links_admin module is still not fully implemented;
	the third feature above detects whether links_admin.module is
	enabled, and right now it should NOT be because it isn't working
	yet.

	Committed patch #133247, by elondaits, which makes display of
	weblinks in the "next category down" optional.

2007-03-17	Syscrusher

	Accepted (with enhancements and some debugging) the code from
	#119050, to allow more than one blank line in links_related.
	Also fixed a minor typo per #128286 (partial fix on that issue).
        This is an interim commit; more to come.

2007-01-28	Syscrusher	Version 5--1-4

	Fixed issue #76803, errors in link display for links_weblink.

2007-01-27	Syscrusher	Version 5--1-3

	Resolved issue #99156 and #109847 (duplicates), for call to
	deprecated form_render() function in links_weblink.module.

	Resolved issue #110317, faulty SQL query in update-weblinks.php.

	Resolved issue #111251, with embedded link detection failing.

	Rearranged menus to be more compliant with Drupal 5.0 menu
	organization.

	Put a stub message into the "links admin" page since that
	module doesn't work yet. Developers will need to comment out
	the stub return to see the under-development form.

2006-09-14	Syscrusher

	Added .info files for each of the four modules in the package.

2006-09-10	Syscrusher

	Updated links.module to make admin menu entries work. Still
	some cosmetic issues with the main admin screen, and the
	link content admin doesn't work at all yet, but it's another
	step toward Drupal 5 compatibility.

2006-09-10	Syscrusher

	Patch from Eaton, per issue #82088, to update Links core
	functionality to Drupal 5.0 (prerelease). This represents a
	significant fork from the 4.7 release. As Eaton points out, this
	is not finished yet, and needs updates especially to the admin
	screens, but it is a significant step forward. Thanks, Eaton!

2006-08-01	Syscrusher

	Based on suggestions from others on development list, moved all
	link administration functions to links_admin.module instead of
	including them with links.module.

	Fixed a bug with the outbound link from the links_admin module.

	Branching all code *except* links_admin.module for DRUPAL-4-7.
	We have a release!

2006-07-24	Syscrusher (contributions by RayZ)

	Committed prompt text patch from RayZ per issue #73879.

	Fixed internal links bug with patch from RayZ per issue #72459.

2006-06-21	Syscrusher (contributions by Eaton, moggy, and douggreen)

	Additional bug correction and feature additions per issue #52639.
	This incorporates all changes contributed by Eaton and posted to
	that issue as of today.

	Corrected problem with "weblinks" menu item, using patch supplied
	by moggy pursuant to issue #53942.

	Fixed top level link per patch from douggreen, issue #67796, with
	modifications of my own added.

2006-04-17	Syscrusher (contributions by Eaton and RayZ)

	Pursuant to issue #52639, initially committed links_views.inc.
	This code is still experimental; please read the issue for details.
	Also please note that this is intentionally *NOT* the latest version
	of links_views.inc. There is some question as to correct handling of
	link titles, and the "_0" version may not be committed, based on the
	outcome of that discussion.

2006-04-17	Syscrusher

	The link query functions that accept a URL now also accept the MD5
	hash of a normalized URL to allow other applications to do a direct
	query. This feature was requested in issue #55113.

	Added EXPERIMENTAL statistics functions to links.inc, as suggested
	in feature request issue #54503. This is just a start; more will
	follow as time permits.

2006-04-08	Syscrusher

	Fixed weblink filtering per issue #54619, to correct bug
	where weblink filter could only find weblink-created links.

	Minor documentation and code format fixes.

2006-04-07	Syscrusher

	Remove leading slashes from URLs in links_l(), to fix
	issue #57431.

	Separated 'access links statistics' from 'access statistics'
	permissions, per issue #57424.

2006-03-23	Syscrusher

	API change: New function links_parse_url() added. This
	function takes just about anything that works as a URL,
	parses it out, and returns the parsed components as well
	as a normalized version. The normalized version is
	synthesized by concatenating the appropriate components
	depending on the URL type, rather than just by using
	regular expressions on the entire URL. This yields a more
	thorough validation and normalization process.

	API change: The function links_normalize_url() now calls
	the new links_parse_url() function to do the heavy lifting.

	NOTE: Because of the above, it is necessary to recalc all
	of the MD5s in the {links} table. This can easily be done
	by using "update.php" (from core Drupal) to apply UPDATE 2
	to the Links package. Most of your URLs will not change,
	but a few may be better normalized. In my testing, a
	database with 500 real URLs had only two changes, both
	of which were manually inspected and found to be legitimate
	normalizations.

	Changed links.install to fix length of {links_node}.module
	to correct issue #55372. This had already been fixed in
	links.mysql, but the change didn't propagate into the new
	install file.

	Removed trailing PHP delimiters from files per coding
	standards (http://drupal.org/node/545), thereby fixing
	issues #55577 and #45940.

	Removed icky DOS carriage returns from lines in links.inc,
	per issue #45940.

2006-03-17	Syscrusher

	Added PREFIXES.txt file to explain module prefixes and to
	establish an informal prefix registry.

	Removed a lot of dead code from links_related.module that
	was left over from its ancestor module before the links API.

	Fixed missing ?> at end of links_related.module (the line
	was mistakenly deleted by a patch).

	Added some explanatory comments to the links.install file.

2006-03-14	Syscrusher

	API change: The function links_goto_bynode now allows a zero
	node ID, as long as the link ID is nonzero. This will perform
	a redirect as usual, though it will not be able to tally the
	click from any specific node.

	Significant improvements to the weblink filter, fixing the
	bug reported by RayZ in issue #53572 and improving its
	handling of links.

2006-03-14	Syscrusher

	Added links.install file contributed by drewish, per issue
	#45940. Test reports welcome.

2006-02-20	Syscrusher

	Committed patch by Webchick to fix issue #49987, SQL error
	on weblinks directory when no weblinks are defined.

2006-02-02	Syscrusher

	Moved node API calls into separate functions, fixing issue
	#43177 reported by Steve Dondley.

2006-02-01	Syscrusher

	Added new links directory view in links_weblink.module. Now
	if you go to q=links/weblink you will see directory of all
	"weblink" type nodes in the system, organized by taxonomy.
	Gracefully handles assignment of multiple vocabularies to
	"weblink" nodes, and gracefully handles taxonomy trees that
	allow multiple parents. Uses the Drupal breadcrumbs functions
	to show ancestry, but only one level up due to the multiple-
	parentage possibility.

	Flexible queries are possible, such as q=links/weblink/15,32
	which would return all links for TIDs 15 or 32.

	The new code is functional but still cosmetically primitive.
	Also, the links catalog is controlled by a new security
	permission, but the rest of the module doesn't respect the
	new setting yet.

	Added more link management functionality to links.module.
	This feature is still not complete, however.

	Updated update-weblinks-old.php to work with latest Drupal
	HEAD version. This has been tested with over 200 nodes.

	Updated update-webstory.php to work with the latest Drupal
	HEAD version. This has now been tested with over 2600 nodes.

	Initial commit of update-weblinks.php, which is designed to
	work with Ber Kessels' newer weblinks module (the one written
	for Drupal 4.6). This particular script is currently UNTESTED
	because I do not have a site running Ber's version. Test reports
	welcome, of course.

	Initial commit of UPGRADE.txt, the instructions for using the
	various update scripts.

2006-01-22	Syscrusher

	DOCUMENTATION: The file API.txt is gone, replaced by API.html
	which I believe will be easier to read.

	The admin...links page is now display-functional. It still
	doesn't actually *do* anything if you submit the form, but
	it does run the query and let you page through the links.
	This page also checks specifically for "links_monitor"
	module and adds a link to Drupal path "admin/links/monitor/$lid"
	if the module is found. This will provide a convenient hook
	for the future monitoring module to use.

	The form to display and edit all references to a given link
	is now also created, though like the primary link admin form
	it doesn't actually do anything yet if it is submitted.

	There is a new administrator setting for links.module that
	controls how many links appear on a page in admin screens.

	URLs for sub-editing functions have been changed from the
	form "admin/links/$lid/$op" to "admin/links/$op/$lid". This
	will make it easier to hook add-in functions into the main
	links admin screen. The plan is to implement a hook function
	to allow any module to add link operations to this screen
	easily.

2006-01-21	Syscrusher

	DOCUMENTATION: I have officially renamed this set of modules
	from "Links Bundle" to "Links Package". Please refer to the
	collection as such in documentation files from here onward.

	API CHANGE: The function links_format_goto_url() now returns
	a raw "Drupal URL" (e.g., "links/goto/275/3") rather than
	processing it through url() or l() before return. If you call
	the links_format_goto_url() function, you need to add a local
	call to the Drupal-corrective functions that manage non-clean-URL
	(i.e., "index.php?q=drupal/url/path") sites. This fixes issue
	#42908 reported by webchick and worked on by Ber Kessels and
	Steve Dondley.

	API CHANGE: The functions links_goto() and links_format_goto_url()
	now accept an optional $module parameter to establish the module
	scope of the request. links_goto_link(), which already accepted
	this parameter, now defaults it to empty instead of 'links',
	with that implying a generic redirection without tallying the
	outbound click (see function comments for detailed explanation).
	Normally, all other modules that call these functions should
	specify their own names in the $module parameter. This change
	enables correct tallying of outbound link clicks.

	The link-hunting functionality for node bodies is working. The
	"links" tab (if enabled) and links endnotes (if enabled) from
	the links_related module now include a separate listing of all
	links found in the node body text, whether raw URLs or enclosed
	in HTML anchor tags. The feature still needs a lot of work --
	in particular, the editing form displays but doesn't actually
	do anything yet. This also addresses bug #44647 reported by
	metapunk and aries. This functionality is part of links_related.

	The display of the embedded links is now a site-configurable
	option in the admin settings for the links_related module.

	The next TODO is to finish bringing links.module up to the 4.7
	forms API, per issue #37385. I am also working on other issues;
	see the project page for details. The links package is still a
	work in progress, but it is getting closer to completion.

2006-01-20	Syscrusher

	Updated the database creation script for the UTF-8 patch per
	http://drupal.org/node/22218#utf8_sql, and added links.install
	for the new update system.

	There was an error with key length being too long in the links_node
	table, because of the new character set. Shortening the module
	column to 60 characters fixed it; it's unlikely anyone would ever
	name a module with a name bigger than that, anyway.

	Corrected URL for setting which node types get related links, in
	links_related.module, per issue #44643 (thanks metapunk).

	Fixed the cosmetic error where link text was being truncated
	even in the endnotes version of the display, in links.inc.

	Applied Eaton's patch from issue #44748 to fix the context $module
	parameter that was incorrect several places in links_related.module.

2005-12-27	Syscrusher

	Fixed SQL query for links_weblink block handler, per issue #42139.
	Patch by naudefj was correct in spirit but made against earlier
	version of module, so applied an equivalent change manually.

2005-12-12	Syscrusher

	NOTE: Users of the previous version need to execute a simple SQL
	command to update the {links_node} table for this version:

	UPDATE links_node SET module='links_related' WHERE module='links';

	(Add the table prefix before links_node if required.)

	Major rewrite of parts of links_weblink. This updated the behavior
	of the forms API, building on contribs from drewish and Eaton. The
	most significant change is that links_weblink now exploits the
	module-context functionality of the links API, to maintain the
	"primary" link for a weblink-type node as a distinct entity
	separate from any related links that may or may not be attached
	to that node (if related links are enabled for "weblink" nodes by
	the sysadmin). In other words, it is now possible to have a weblink
	whose semantics are "This weblink points to XYZ web site; here are
	some related URLs as a 'see also' reference." Sites might use this
	functionality to have the weblink itself point to a main page but
	some related links point to especially interesting sub-pages. Since
	related links are allowed/disallowed by the site admin, anyone who
	doesn't like that notion can simply not enable them for weblink
	nodes (that is the default situation).

	In short the default behavior of links_weblink is now rather similar
	to the behavior of the old weblinks module, but it can be configured
	to add new flexibility if the webmaster prefers.

	links_weblink now has a settings page to control its behavior.
	Those who have been working with the previous version may need to
	flush the cache to make this item visible in the admin menu.

	Other significant changes:

	New API: array links_get_list($module, &$node, $page, $teaser)
	Builds a simple array containing links for the specified node, in
	the specified module context. This function is simply a refactoring
	of links_related_list() to make it available for reuse by other
	modules (notably links_weblink).

	API change: Re-ordered parameters for links_save_links_for_node()
	to put $module second rather than last. This was done to make
	the save and load functions more symmetrical, and because $module
	was found to be used more often than expected.

	API change: Added a $global flag to links_save_links_for_node().
	When TRUE, this causes an altered URL for a link to change that
	link globally in the {links} table. Without $global, a new URL
	either catalogs the new link, or (if the new URL already exists
	in the catalog) changes {links_node}.lid to point to the new URL
	record in {links}. $global requires the 'change url globally'
	user permission.

	Added the 'change_url_globally' permission in links.module. (See
	preceding paragraph for description.)

	New API: string links_sort_get_parms($url)
        Takes all of the GET parameters in the URL string and sorts them
        alphabetically. This helps make URLs that have the same parms and
        values, but in different order, normalize the same so they will
        be merged in the database.

	API change: links_get_links_for_node() renamed to
        links_load_links_for_node() for consistency with the "load/save"
	terminology used elsewhere in Drupal.

	API semantics change: The $module parameter for functions
	links_get_links_for_node() and links_load_links_for_node() has
	changed to allow *any* module to use it. The string "links_"
	is no longer automatically prepended. Correct syntax for this
	parameter is now the full module name (e.g., "links_related"
	or "links_weblink" or "my_other_module") rather than just the
	part of the module after "links_". Default for the parameter
	is now "links", implying a globally-shared link/node mapping.
	Note that none of the modules in the links package itself
	rely on that default, and normally external modules won't, either.
	As before, leaving this parameter blank implies an operation that
	affects *all* links for a node in *all* module contexts -- this
	should be used with great caution, and probably only in sysadmin
	situations rather than applications.

	The database initialization scripts no longer drop tables.

	Minor bug fixes in links.inc, related to the $module context
	parameter on the save and load functions. Additional documentation
	for developers in API.txt.

2005-12-09	Syscrusher

	Fixed nonfunctional user-specific preference settings.

	Fixed problems with missing explicitly-declared values for
	settings fields, in option lists.

	#39877.

	Committed a small patch by drewish to fix issue #40070.

	There are still known bugs in the node editing form; I'm working

2005-11-19	Syscrusher

	Added hook_node_info() implementation in links_weblink.module.
	Fixes issue #38176, patch by Eaton.

2005-11-13	Syscrusher

	Committed changes by Eaton, per issue #37385, to begin moving to
	Drupal 4.7 forms API. A *big* thanks to Eaton for this patch set!

	Corrected error in HTML pointed out by xqus in issue #36853.
	Good catch, xqus.

	Committed link editing code from xqus, per issue #35675, and then
	converted this new code to Drupal 4.7 forms API.

	WARNING: This version is NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL. In particular, there
	is a known infinite loop on adding content with related links. DO
	NOT use for production, and the link admin page now does not show
	any links in its list. This is an interim commit of work in progress.

2005-11-01	Syscrusher

	Added links.pgsql, kindly contributed by "mok000". This addresses
	issue #35006.

2005-07-13	Syscrusher

	Fixed error with key being too long in the MySQL table creation
	script. Addresses bug #26414.

2005-06-16	Syscrusher

	Major enhancements to links_related.module, including a feature to
	locate embedded links and make them available for editing and
	migration into the catalog. THIS IS NOT YET COMPLETE; the module
	is currently EXPERIMENTAL status.

2005-06-15	Syscrusher

	Continued progress in the code building. Added new functions to
	links.inc and links.module for more robust handling of the target
	selection for links. There is now an option for new window only on
	external links.

	Fixed some bugs in the database updates, where trivial cases were
	trying to execute empty queries.

	Added new function links_l() which works like the l() from Drupal
	core (and, indeed, calls it internally) but which respects the
	admin and user settings for link targets.

2005-06-10	Syscrusher

	Initial commit of links package code into modules directory of HEAD
	branch. Package is usable but not yet completed. API is mostly stable,
	database schema is (at least in theory) stable, in that no further
	changes are *planned* at this time.

	This is very definitely ALPHA TEST code, however, so use at own
	risk, and only in a development/preview environment.
