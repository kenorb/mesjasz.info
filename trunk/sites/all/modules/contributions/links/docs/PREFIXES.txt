This file is an informally-maintained registry of the module prefixes that are
used in the Links API calls for the $module parameter.

The actual URLs cataloged by the Links API are global to all Drupal modules,
but the references in the {links_node} table that map these URLs to individual
nodes can be made local to a specific module or module package.

Module developers who use the Links API may request a namespace prefix string
that allows their modules to create such application-specific link references.
Once you have a prefix, anything "under" that prefix is yours to name as you
wish.

Suppose, for instance, that you register the prefix "example". You can then
store links with $module="example" and be (reasonably) assured that no other
module will tinker with the link-node mapping (the URL itself, however, is
managed by links.module globally).

The underscore can be used to create sub-namespaces within your registered prefix,
to any desired nesting depth. So if instead of just example.module you are
creating "the Example package" with modules example.module, example_view.module,
example_taxonomy.module, and so on, you can (if you wish) carve up your
namespace with $module="example", $module="example_view", and
$module="example_taxonomy". You are not *required* to do this -- it is purely
up to you, depending on whether your modules should share link references or
treat them separately. Basically, you may place any string after the "example_"
prefix that you wish as long as it fits into the database column.

Prefix registrations should be considered case-insensitive; that is, if you
reserve "example" no one else can reserve "Example" or "EXAMPLE" because they
are treated as equal by the API. Also, ownership of "example" implies ownership
of "example_*" but NOT of "example*" (so, for instance, you don't get
"examples" or "examplemania" or "examplethemes").
