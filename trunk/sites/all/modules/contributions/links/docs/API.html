<h1>Links Package API Documentation</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
The links package provides a number of application modules, but it also is
specifically intended to provide an application programming interface (API)
that can be used by other modules. The API is intended to be relatively
stable, and over time additions will be more likely than changes to exisitng
functions. Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain as much backward
compatibility as possible, though of course some changes are inevitable.
<p>
Any modules that rely on the links API should respect the setting of system
and user-specific configuration variables that are set by this package, so
that modules will behave consistently. These variables control preferences
such as whether links display as a title or as a raw URL, opening of new
browser windows when links are clicked, and so on.
<p>
Modules are, of course, permitted to set their own variables. The string
"links_" as a variable prefix should be reserved to modules that are an
official part of this package. If your add on module isn't, please pick a
different variable prefix.
<p>
It is also permitted for an add-on module to offer a setting that
overrides what the basic links package has defined. In such cases, it is
strongly recommended that the add-on module use the links-package-defined
value for that option as its default, and document that fact accordingly.

<h2>API CATEGORIES</h2>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Hooks</dt>
<dd>At certain times, the Links API will offer an opportunity for other
  modules to inject their own behavior or activity into the process.
  See the section "HOOKS" below for details.
</dd>
<dt>URL functions</dt>
<dd>These are the functions that operate on the URL string itself, rather than
  being related to the link as a destination web page. These functions are
  largely concerned with "normalizing" URLs so that they are as uniform as
  possible. This is of critical importance to the package, because every
  effort is made to merge URLs that point to the same page into a single
  row in the {links} table, even if they are referenced from multiple nodes.
  This saves time when validating or updating links.
</dd>
<dt>Text search and edit functions</dt>
<dd>x These functions are concerned with finding, cataloging, and manipulating
  links that are found within an arbitrary text string, such as a node body.
</dd>
<dt>URL hash functions</dt>
<dd>The database maintains an MD5 hash of each normalized URL, to allow more
  rapid searches for a record matching a new URL. Remember that URLs with
  a lot of GET parameters can be very long, which means inefficiency of
  database searches when the URL itself is the key. The hash doesn't help
  with ordered listing of multiple rows, but that is an unusual case
  when the URL is the key. Generally, in that situation, you are looking
  for just a single exact match, and the MD5 greatly speeds that lookup.
</dd>
<dt>Database functions</dt>
<dd>These functions manage the process of retrieving links from the database,
  and of adding, modifying, or removing links. They also manage the mapping
  of links to nodes, which is potentially a many-to-many mapping. That is,
  any given link may be mapped to zero, one, or many nodes, and any given
  node may map to zero, one, or many link records.
</dd>
<dt>Link redirection functions</dt>
<dd>These are used to "trap" the process of the browser actually visiting
  a link, so that the link's tally can be updated or a "you are leaving this
  website" message can be presented to the user for legal disclaimers or
  similar reasons.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>DATABASE SCHEMA DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
The database schema for the links package uses only a couple of tables.
This section explains those tables field-by-field, though it should be
emphasized that it is STRONGLY encouraged for add-on modules to rely on
the API calls to access the database (especially for updates) rather than
doing SQL directly. The APIs are specifically designed to insulate modules
from the details of the schema. The maintainer of this package is open
to adding or enhancing APIs if there is missing but needed functionality,
in preference to having modules do a lot of direct SQL on these tables.

<h2>Additional database notes</h2>

<h3>{links} and {links_node} Tables</h3>

<h4>NORMALIZING URLS</h4>
<p>
As indicated above, it is *imperative* that no URL be put into the {links}
table unless it has first been processed by links_normalize_url(), else many
things break. The design of the links package presumes that all links in the
database are normalized by this particular function. Modules that need things
to be otherwise will need their own tables. It is *strongly* recommended to
perform database updates using only the API functions rather than SQL.
<p>
<h4>GLOBAL (DEFAULT) AND NODE-SPECIFIC LINK TITLES</h4>
<p>
The title field here is assigned the first time each link is cataloged into
the table, but can be changed by someone with appropriate administrative
level. The API has a function to assign a reasonable title based on whatever
information the application module can give it (up to and including a specific
title to assign, or down to making a cleaned-up version of the raw URL if that
is all that is available). Nodes that attach this link to themselves can either
supply their own title (which is stored in {links_node}) or can accept the
default. The first node that catalogs a link gets to establish the default.
All of these semantics are handled in the API.
<p>
Note that the localization of title to node also allows for translations.
It is suggested that the default for any given link URL (that is, the
link_title field in {links} should be the title of the web page in the
native language of the page itself, but that is not mandated by the API.
If, for example, a web page in French is cataloged initially by a French-
speaking contributor, he or she would establish the default language of
that link. Later on, that node could be translated into English (for
example) as a new node, and when that new node attaches the same link,
it can choose to retitle the link -- locally only -- in English, or can
allow the title to remain French even though the rest of the node is English.
<p>
There is potential here for an add-on module that does what editasnew.module
does, but with the added twist of copying the {links_node} references and
allowing them to be optionally retitled for the new node.
<p>
Translation is not the only situation where retitling makes sense. In some
cases, the way a link is "called out" within a node is not its canonical
title. For example, suppose someone is creating a links directory and adds
a link about the history of tweedle glomping, http://example.com/tweedles.html.
The title of that page is "Intro to Tweedle Glomping", and so it's added to
the database in that way. Later on, one of the site's members may refer to
the same URL in a blog post, as "A terrific article about tweedle glomping",
and may want it to appear that way in the blog post. The node-local title
of the link allows this to happen without requiring that the URL itself be
replicated in the database.
<p>
This may seem like a fanatical level of link-duplication avoidance, but the
scanning process for dead, redirected, and changed links consumes both time
and server resources, and it is therefore worthwhile to avoid scanning the
same page multiple times.
<p>
<h4>OUTBOUND CLICK TRACKING</h4>
<p>
Clicks of links are counted in the {links_node} table rather than directly
in {links} so that administrative tools can tell not only how many times
a link is followed, but also from where it was clicked. It is easy enough
to use the SQL function SUM() to tally all the clicks for a given link,
e.g., "SELECT SUM(clicks) FROM {links_node} WHERE lid=...".
<p>
The last_click_time field exists to allow site administrators to easily
identify outbound links that are never used, as possible candidates for
pruning. It is intended that in the future a comprehensive links management
module will intelligently analyze how many clicks each link has, what nodes
generated those clicks, and how recently each link has been followed, to
help administrators manage large links catalogs rationally.
<p>
<h4>MODULE-LOCAL LINK REFERENCES</h4>
<p>
The module reference in {links_node} is intended to localize link references
to the module that creates and manages them. This allows the same node to
reference a given link in multiple ways without collisions. For example,
you may have a site in which the node type "weblink" (which intrinsically
defines a single primary link because that's what the node is all about)
can also have optional related links, or may have embedded links within
the node body.
<p>
Add-on modules are free to use a suffix after their name in the module
column, so for example, my_module could use "my_module", "my_module.xyz",
"my_module.something_else", and so on. The period is the recommended
delimiter between a module's official name and any internal suffix it
uses in the {links_node} table.
<p>
<h3>{links_monitor} Table</h3>
<p>
The links monitoring function is still under development, so this table's
schema is subject to change. Conceptually, the plan for links monitoring
is that it scans each link at intervals set by the site administrator,
either specifically stored with the link or a site-wide default, to find
destination pages that:
<ol type="1">
<li>Have moved (i.e., looking for an HTTP redirect)</li>
<li>Have disappeared (looking for a "404" HTTP error)</li>
<li>Have changed (looking for modification date in the HTTP headers, or
   actually comparing the content of the page since our last scan.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The {links_monitor} table supports these three functions. Here is the intended
semantics of each column:
<dl>
<dt>lid</dt>
<dd>Points back to the {links} table.
</dd>
<dt>check_interval</dt>
<dd>How many seconds are recommended between scans of this
particular link? Zero implies use of a system default
for this link. A link that should not be monitored at
all is implied by a missing row from {links_monitor}.
</dd>
<dt>last_check</dt>
<dd>The timestamp (Drupal-standard format) of the last time
a scan of this link completed, whether or not the page
was successfully retrieved.
</dd>
<dt>fail_count</dt>
<dd>The number of failed retrieval attempts consecutively;
that is, this counter is reset by successful retrieval.
</dd>
<dt>alternate_monitor_url</dt>
<dd>In some situations, we want to store a "friendly" URL in
the database even though it redirects to somewhere else.
For example, suppose http://example.com/myblog redirects
to http://blogs.example.net/blogs/user/23587/blog.jsp.
Or a URL may point to a load-sharing redirector that
redirects to a randomly-selected mirror, or a locale-
or language-specific mirror, in which case we want to
catalog only the "published" version of the URL. This
field tells the monitoring software to scan *this*
URL rather than the displayable one stored in {links}.
</dd>
<dt>redirect_proposed_url</dt>
<dd>When the scanner finds an HTTP redirect, it can either
automatically update the URL in {links}, or it can
make a note of the new URL from the redirect, and store
it in this field for administrator approval before it
replaces the {links} URL. This field is nulled out once
the redirection is accepted.
</dd>
<dt>redirect_saved_url</dt>
<dd>If a redirected URL is accepted (automatically or by
administrative approval), the old URL from {links} is
stored here to allow a single level of "undo" in case
of trouble. NOTE: It may be desirable to inhibit auto-
update from redirect on any link if this field is
non-empty, to prevent looping redirects on the same
link from load-sharing systems. If that is done, then
the site administrative interface may want to flag as
high priority any link that has this field *and* the
redirect_proposed_url field populated, so that the
site admin can figure out what is going on.
</dd>
<dt>change_threshold</dt>
<dd>This field's interpretation depends on the change-
detection algorithm employed by the monitor logic. It
could be as simple as a byte-count delta, as it was in
older versions of weblink.module, or it could be more
sophisticated. The content of this field, in any case,
represents how large the "computed change amount" must
be in order to consider the page "changed". This is
designed to allow ignoring trivial changes, such as a
site that puts the current date and time near the top
of the page and therefore "changes" -- but not in any
meaningful way -- every minute.
</dd>
<dt>change_flag</dt>
<dd>When a monitor scan detects a meaningful level of
change to the destination page, it sets this flag to
a nonzero value. The links package does not act on this
information, but add-on modules could take some action
such as automatically creating and promoting a "story"
node to announce the change.
</dd>
<dt>change_last_data</dt>
<dd>This field contains whatever arbitrary information is
needed by the monitor logic, as a baseline comparison.
It is updated the first time a page is successfully
retrieved, or any time the change_threshold is met.
In effect, the semantics of this field are "this is
the page's fingerprint from the last time it changed",
which is not necessarily the same as its fingerprint the
last time it was scanned.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<h2>HOOK DETAILS</h2>
<p>
These are the hooks that are invoked by the Links modules at certain times
to allow other modules to interact with the process.
<p>
Note that when you declare a hook function you need to precede it with
the name of your own module. For example, to implement the hook
links_delete_link_reference in my_app module, you would declare:
<code>function my_app_links_delete_link_reference($lid)</code>.

<h3>links_delete_link_reference</h3>
<p>
This hook is invoked by links.inc whenever it needs to delete references
to a particular link from any modules. This may be because the link is about
to be removed from the master table. In any case, the modules MUST remove their
references; there is no option to abort. Modules may decide for themselves what
fallback action to take if a link reference is removed that they still needed.
<p>
Parameters:
<dl>
<dt>$lid</dt>
<dd>The link ID of the link whose references are to be deleted. The module
MUST delete all of its references in tables other than {links_node}. It
SHOULD also delete its own references -- but not others! -- that are in
{links_node}. However, links.inc itself will delete any remaining references
in {links_node} after it calls this hook. So if your module only uses
{links_node} and has no custom tables with link IDs in them, it may not
be necessary to implement this hook. See links_related.module for a
typical implementation of this hook, and links_weblink.module for a
more complex implementation.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Return value: NONE

<h3>links_update_link_reference</h3>
<p>
This hook is invoked by links.inc to indicate that all references to one link
ID should be updated to another link ID. This can happen if someone edits the
master {links} table and changes a URL for a link into one that matches another
existing link. In this case, links.inc will merge the links' references using
this hook.
<p>
links.inc itself will update all rows in {links_node}, so if your module
does not store link references elsewhere and it does not need to intercept
the event for other reasons, you may not need to implement this hook.
<p>
Parameters:
<dl>
<dt>$old_lid</dt>
<dd>The link ID of the old link whose references are to be changed.
</dd>
<dt>$new_lid</dt>
<dd>The new link ID to which the references should be changed.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Return value: NONE

<h3>links_admin_operations</h3>
<p>
This hook is defined by links_admin.module to allow other modules to inject
new behaviors into its "update options" selection dialog. If the user selects
one of the added behaviors, links_admin.module will call a specified callback
function and pass it a simple array of the selected link IDs.
<p>
Parameters:
<dl>
<dt>$section</dt>
<dd>The form section (screen name) for which link operations are being
requested. Current values are 'links' for the master link edit screen
and 'links_node' for the screen that edits references to a single link.
If a module does not implement a section, it should return NULL or an
empty array for that section by default.
</dd>
<p>
Return value: A nested associative array where the outer array keys are
the internal names of the operation. Your module should begin its keys with
the module name, e.g., "my_module_do_something", "my_module_do_other", etc.
The elements of the array are associative inner arrays, where the keys
are "label" and "callback". "label" should contain the human-readable
description of the operation, pre-passed through t() by your module. "callback"
should be the name of a function that you wish called if the user selects
your operation. You may pass multiple operations. Refer to admin.module,
function links_admin_links_admin_operations(), for an example of this
hook's implementation.

<h3>links_admin_link_required</h3>
<p>
When links_admin.module is about to delete a link, it calls this hook to
allow node modules to indicate that their link is required in order for the
node itself to be valid. The quintessential example of this is links_weblink.module,
because of course a "weblink" node is useless if its link is gone. The hook allows
a single module to return multiple such declarations, and these are used to warn
the user before they continue deleting the link(s). The warnings are issued only
if your module happens to have references in {links_node} for the link that is
being deleted.
<p>
If your module does not define node types, or if (like links_related.module) the
node types do not require the links in order to be viable, then you do not have
to implement this hook.
<p>
Parameters: NONE
<p>
Return value: An associative array of the form $node_type=>$module, with zero
or more entries. $module should be the name of your module as it is known to
Drupal (not the human-readable name). $node_type is the internal type of the
node as it would appear in the "type" column of the {node} table.

<h2>FUNCTION DETAILS</h2>
<p>
Many of the API functions accept a paramter $module that limits the context of
their actions. This parameter is very important, and is discussed in detail in
the MODULE-LOCAL LINK REFERENCES section of the database schema description
(see above).
