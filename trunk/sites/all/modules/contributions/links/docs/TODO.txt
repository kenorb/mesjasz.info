TODO list for links package, with items grouped by module.

links.inc

	Will be adding API functions to support monitoring and validation of
	links. This code will be contributed primarily by webchick.

links_related.module

	Need to fix sorting and deletion of links in the node edit form.

	Implement a zero/one/many tristate option for related links, rather than
	just the current yes/no.

links_weblink.module

	Need to have the "related links" fieldset expanded, not collapsed, when
	editing a "weblink" node, because in that situation the link is
	required.

	In validation, require the URL to be present.

links_admin.module

	This is still in ALPHA test and development, and not yet fully functional.
	It is not tagged for the 4.7 branch and is not part of the standard
	download package yet.

Migration from older versions of weblink.module

	Integrate migration scripts into new install/update support framework.

	Test migration script from 4.6 weblink.module. This uses a similar
	schema to the one used by the links package, but does not share each
	link between 1 to N nodes and does not (as best I can tell) use the
	links API to normalize the link URLs. No major problem to handle this
	in the migration script, but it isn't done yet.
