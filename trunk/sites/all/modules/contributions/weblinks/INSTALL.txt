 INSTALL.txt file for Weblinks.

INSTALL.txt file
================

1. Standard module installation applies. See http://drupal.org/node/273907

2. The Settings pages can be found at "admin >> site configuration >> weblinks"
   "http://www.example.com/admin/settings/weblinks"

6. There are three CSS files distributed with the module.
   weblinks.css       - The standard distributed styling that highlights
       the data that the developers feel are important to this module.
   weblinks_minimal.css - A very "vanilla" CSS that does almost no styling
       so your theme can take over.
   weblinks_fancy.css - A "fancy" style sheet that "punches up" the module's
       output. It uses color values chosen from the default Garland color set
       (Blue Lagoon). This means you may switch the module to the basic file
       and then copy the "fancy" CSS into the default Garland "styles.css"
       and the Color module will convert those colors into values that are
       appropriate for the color set you choose when you configure the theme.

   If you don't like the styling of the module, you may rename
   one of the others to "weblinks.css".
