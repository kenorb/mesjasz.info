to collect those questions into quizzes.

main Quiz module and at least one question type module are required to be both
installed and enabled for this module to function properly.

I'd like to extend a heart-felt thank you to the folks at Google for their 
Summer of Code program, without which my working on this module would not have 
been possible. I'd also like to extend my thanks to Robert Douglass as my mentor 
on this project, for his tireless patience and faith in my abilities, and the 
entire Drupal development community for their support while I struggled with
foreign concepts like 'node' and 'taxonomy.' You guys all provided me with 
support, encouragement, and fun times and I sincerely hope to remain a part of 
the Drupal community for a long time to come!

Also huge thanks go to Ejovi Nuwere of http://www.securitylab.net/ for 
sponsoring further module development after Summer of Code.
