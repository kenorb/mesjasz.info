Hooks you need to implement when developing a new question type:

hook_list_questions() // List of questions
hook_quiz_question_info() // Info about a question type.
hook_evaluate_question() // Check whether question is correct or not.
hook_get_report()
hook_render_question()

hook_quiz_question_score() // Given information about a quiz question, determine the score
hook_quiz_personality_question_score() // Given information about a quiz question, determine the personality category

Theme functions
===============
Where {$type} is the question type, e.g. multichoice or long_answer...

theme_{$type}_report() // Report at end of quiz
theme_{$type}_feedback() // Feedback given during the taking of the quiz.
