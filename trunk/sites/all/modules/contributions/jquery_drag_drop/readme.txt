  README.txt for Jquery Drag Drop for Blocks.module for Drupal
*******************************************************

This module written by developers at Ebizon Technologies (www.ebizontek.com) enables drag-drop on blocks. The regions on which those blocks can be dragged are configurable through admin section. It depends on the Interface Sortable and JQuery Interface module which in turn relies on the JQuery Update module.

INSTALLATION:

1. Put the jquery_drag_drop directory in the modules directory that makes
   the most sense for your site.  See http://drupal.org/node/70151 for tips
   on where to install contributed modules.
2. Enable jquery_drag_drop via admin/build/modules.
