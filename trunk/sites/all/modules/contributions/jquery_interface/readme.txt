Interface is a collection of rich interface components which utilizes 
the lightweight JavaScript library jQuery. With this components you can 
build rich client web applications and interfaces with the same simplicity 
as writing JavaScript with jQuery.

This module simply places Interface in a central location with one command
that can be called from any module that wants to use the library.

A module should simply call:

	jquery_interface_add()
	
The module takes no arguments and returns no value, but it will include
interface.js on the page.

More information about Interface can be found at http://interface.eyecon.ro/
along with complete documentation.

The Interface library included here depends on JQuery version 1.1.x. Drupal 5
comes with version 1.0.1, so you will need to update JQuery using the
JQuery Update module.

Enjoy!
